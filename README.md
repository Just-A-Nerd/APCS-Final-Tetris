# APCS-Final-Tetris
A version of tetris for our APCS Final Project. Other block shapes will be included.

#### Things to be done before Tuesday, June 6
Make leveling up increase game speed
Display next block in box
Add O and I blocks
Add pentiminoes

#### Other things to be done
Music and sound effects

#### Known bugs
If a blocksquare is written in the buffer zone (from rotating the block when it first appears) it will stay like that forever
Sometimes blocksquares will keep falling if the down key is held and the block hits bottom
The console spits out large errors when the player tries to spin a block next to the wall (doesn't actually affect the game)
Tetriminoes on the left overwrite the white border thing
