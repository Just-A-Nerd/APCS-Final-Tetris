# APCS-Final-Tetris
A version of tetris for our APCS Final Project. Other block shapes will be included.

#### Things to be done before Tuesday, June 6

Add I block
Add pentiminoes

#### Other things to be done
Music and sound effects

#### Known bugs
Blocks can't move during the loop interval when they are at the bottommost point

The console spits out large errors when the player tries to spin a block next to the wall (doesn't actually affect the game)

Tetriminoes on the left overwrite the white border thing
